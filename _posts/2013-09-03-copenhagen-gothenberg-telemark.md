I'm calling this week zero because the miles per weekend idea hadn't occured to us when we took this trip but in many ways the little germ seedling of inspiration was planted on this trip because we saw so much and had such an adventure. We suprised ourselves with what could be done in a weekend.

The bike was already in Copenhagen because I had been working there for the summer. I collected Jo from KÃ¸benhavns Lufthavne on Friday evening and despite her long trip and transfer stops in London and Amsterdam, she insisted we crack on. We reached Gothenberg in a cold wet mess but made ourselves comfortable with a hot meal and a warm bed at a fancy hotel on the river. The Swedes were charming and the bartender knew his trade. In the morning, they gave us access to the laundry room to dry all our wet gear. The Novotel treated us well, you can tell 'em I said so.

I might finish this write-up at some point, but for now, you'll have to make do with [the pictures](https://plus.google.com/photos/100557451161674433638/albums/5919455836733926625).

####Circumstance must not be permitted to interfere with adventure.

Like a lot of people, I was finding it impossible to quit my job and live the dream of open roads and high seas adventures. People kept telling me to make better use of my weekends, so now, I'm going to.

I'm taking my &pound;800, 2001 Kawasaki ER5, with 40k already on the clock, from Plymouth, Devon, to Hanoi. Yes, the one in Vietnam. Since I've already ridden it up to London, the journey has already begun. :)

Much, if not all, of our progress will be on weekends, because that's the time I have available. I will try to reach an airport each Sunday evening, where I will secure the bike to a lamp-post and buy a return ticket to London. Come Friday, I'll use my return flight to pick up the bike and make another weekend of progress towards reaching Vietnam.

I'm strapping a new Contour +2 HD camera to my head to record the endeavour, so all you armchair adventurers can laugh along with everything that's bound to go wrong.

When my beautiful wife isn't <a href="http://www.yogaloft.co.uk">busy being bendy</a>, she'll join me two-up in the sunshine.
